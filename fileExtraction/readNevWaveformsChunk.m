%
%  [waveforms, complete] = readNevWaveformsChunk(fid, header, waveBytesPerSample, scaleFactor, nPacketsToRead, snippetLen, firstSnippetPt);
%
%  This function converts a chunk of a NEV file into matlab using only
%  script commands. Includes waveforms.
%  
%  Inputs:
%
%     fid        - a file handle to an open .nev file (read-only, binary).
%                  Should be open to the start of a data packet.
%
%     header     - header from the .nev file
%
%     waveBytesPerSample - how many bytes in each sample of the waveform.
%                          Should be gotten from the spikeheaders.
%
%     scaleFactor - conversion factor between values stored in .nev file
%                   and uV (note: this is 1000 x what is in the
%                   spikeheaders)
%
%     nPacketsToRead - number of packets to read from the file. Will
%                      probably return fewer waveforms, since some packets
%                      are digital I/O!
%
%     snippetLen - length of each snippet. Probably 32. Will yield a
%                  snippet from point firstSnippetPt to firstSnippetPt +
%                  snippetLen - 1.
%
%     firstSnippetPt - first point of each snippet to use.
%
%  Outputs:
%
%     waveforms - A nPts by W array of waveforms data, matched up with the
%                 spikes data. W will be <= nPacketsToRead.
%
%     complete  - 1 if this was the last chunk of the file, 0 otherwise

% that we'll be in the right place for the next chunk (if applicable).
